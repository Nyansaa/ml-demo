# ML Demo â€“ Time-Series Anomaly Detection

This repository contains a non-proprietary machine learning demo to showcase my coding style, documentation, and problem-solving approach.  

## Overview
The project demonstrates how to build and evaluate a Random Forest model for anomaly detection on time-series data.  
It includes feature engineering, model training, validation, and performance visualization.  

## Files
- `newfe.py`: Main pipeline script with data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.  
- `requirements.txt`: Dependencies needed to run the script.  

## Tools
Python, NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, PyWavelets  

## Results
The pipeline outputs metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, and generates plots for evaluation.  

## Notes
Due to project restrictions I cannot share code from my NASA collaboration or internships.  
This demo was prepared independently as a non-proprietary sample.
